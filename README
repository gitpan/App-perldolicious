NAME
    perldolicious - Mojolicious::Lite webapp that lets you search (with
    regexp) and display CPAN modules documentation

VERSION
    Version 0.004.

SYNOPSIS
      perldolicious daemon
      # now point your web browser to the address http://localhost:3000/

      # or use a different port
      perldolicious daemon -l http://localhost:8000

      # or use the Mojolicious' builtin webserver morbo (assuming
      # perldolicious is installed in /usr/local/bin)
      morbo /usr/local/bin/perldolicious

DESCRIPTION
  FEATURES
    *   Search CPAN modules with regular expressions.

    *   Modules that you wish to see its documentation don't have to be
        installed on your system. Since perldolicious uses Pod::Cpandoc
        under the hood.

    *   Pretty fast, since it stores the modules list cache in Storable
        format.

    *   Gradient-free, no-nonsense webpage. Although it'll cheerfully blink
        when necessary (it's all about priorities).

CONFIGURATIONS
    You can configure the behavior of perldolicious by writing configuration
    file, stored at ~/.perldolicious/config.json (written in JSON format).
    Here are the recognized options:

    *   cpan_package_file - use a different cpan package file. I don't know
        what people call this file, so I'm going to refer it as "cpan
        package file" throughout this document. Default location is
        ~/.cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz. Example for
        Strawbery Perl users:

          {
              "cpan_package_file": "c:/StrawberryPerl/cpan/sources/modules/02packages.details.txt.gz"
          }

    *   modules_cache_file - specify different location to store the modules
        list cache file. Default is ~/.perldolicious/modules.storable.

    *   quiet - tell perldolicious to be more quiet. Default: false.

    Example:

      $ cat ~/.perldolicious/config.json
      {
          "quiet": 1,
          "modules_cache_file": "/Users/Syaltut/.modules"
      }

LIMITATIONS
    *   No pagination - which means you shouldn't use patterns like ".*" if
        you don't want your browser to eat up all of your computer's memory.

TODOS
    *   Add the ability to recognize out-of-date cpan package file and
        redownload it (or probably add an option to auto download it after
        specified amount of time).
